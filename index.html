                    Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Gabriel Smith, I am 25 years old, and I am currently
                    living in Boise, Idaho. I am currently going to Boise State University as a student looking to earn
                    his Game Design degree through the GIMM Program there with the hope of becoming a programmer or
                    working with audio.
                    <br>
                    Ever since I was young I have always loved video games and became fascinated with how they work and
                    function, paired with an overactive imagination
                    and the want to turn these thoughts into reality through what I had, whether that's through writing,
                    interacting with my
                    childhood friends, or getting into D&D. All of which which led me to taking a computer science and
                    an animation class in middle school. When I got to college I ended up getting an associates in
                    Animal Science
                    before deciding to head back to school to get a game design degree.
                    <br>
                    Since getting into the program I've gotten to create a few different types of video games: 2D, AR,
                    3D, and even VR. I've also gotten to work on different aspects of game design
                    from programming, art, and even video and audio, examples of which are shown in the Artifacts
                    section if you want to look at them. I even managed to get onto the dean's list during a Sophmore
                    semester!

                <p>This is the very first project I got in GIMM: the creation of a simple 2D game in Unity. This project
                    taught me the basics of game design and using the Unity engine to design a game. I learned
                    programming like how to move a character around, make them jump, make them attack, code a health
                    pool, and code enemies that move around and damage you.
                    It was stressful, especially for a first project, but in the end I am proud of what I did with it
                    even if it doesn’t look great. And it was fun to learn the basics and see what I can do with it.

                <p>My first GIMM project done with a group. Like Hero of Astagon it’s a 2D game, but this time it used
                    XR elements by having the player hold up a card to a webcam that can be used to open chests and
                    doors.
                    It was a very hard project to do, especially the XR part which was a group effort to make sure it
                    worked properly, but it was interesting to learn how to use XR in games.

                <p>My second group project in GIMM was this: a comic book explaining some sort of quantum physics topic.
                    The topic was random and my group got Consciousness, Death, and how that applies to Quantum Physics.
                    It took a lot of research and then the rest of the time was spent drawing, animating, and coding the
                    assignment in Unity, which I was the main programmer for.
                    Compared to my other artifacts it probably isn’t much, but I had a good time programming it like the
                    slider, pan function, and buttons to pull images and change the page. They were also a great group
                    to work with and I learned a lot about the esoteric topic we got.
