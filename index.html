                    Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Gabriel Smith, I am 25 years old, and I am currently
                    living in Boise, Idaho. I am currently going to Boise State University as a student looking to earn
                    his Game Design degree through the GIMM Program there with the hope of becoming a programmer or working with audio.
                    <br>
                    Ever since I was young I have always loved video games and became fascinated with how they work and function, paired with an overactive imagination
                    and the want to turn these thoughts into reality through what I had, whether that's through writing, interacting with my
                    childhood friends, or getting into D&D. All of which which led me to taking a computer science and an animation class in middle school. When I got to college I ended up getting an associates in Animal Science 
                    before deciding to head back to school to get a game design degree.
                    <br>
                    Since getting into the program I've gotten to create a few different types of video games: 2D, AR, 3D, and even VR. I've also gotten to work on different aspects of game design
                    from programming, art, and even video and audio, examples of which are shown in the Artifacts section if you want to look at them. I even managed to get onto the dean's list during a Sophmore semester!
